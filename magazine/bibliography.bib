Such systems are naturally spatial in that they can only be understood in terms of the ways in which components meet and interact in space. Rather than treating spatiality separately from system components, researchers are starting to develop computational models in which the entire structure of a pervasive system is modelled and constructed using an explicit spatial model, supporting multi-level spatial reasoning, and adapting autonomously to spatial interactions. In this paper, we review current and emerging models of spatial computing for pervasive ecosystems, and highlight some of the trends that will guide future research.}, number={4}, journal={The Knowledge Engineering Review}, publisher={Cambridge University Press}, author={Dobson, Simon and Viroli, Mirko and Fernandez-Marquez, Jose Luis and Zambonelli, Franco and Stevenson, Graeme and Di Marzo Serugendo, Giovanna and Montagna, Sara and Pianini, Danilo and Ye, Juan and Castelli, Gabriella and et al.}, year={2016}, month={Sep}, pages={343–366}}
